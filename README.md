# IFT6266

The following repository contains the source code for my implementation of different model and architectures for the projet of the course ift6266 at Universit√© de Montreal
The project page with the description is the following: https://ift6266h17.wordpress.com/project-description/
The link to the blogpost with the details of the project is : https://wperrault.wordpress.com/

The Code Final folder contains all the final code and the folders (e.g : DCGAN1) gather example images for every tested model

(The submit time is on the 1st of may at 12h because there was a problem with the uploads so they had to be put uploaded manually on the website)
